Event Overview:
The event involves a debugging challenge designed to test programming skills and problem-solving abilities.
Participants will work on coding questions which includes two sets: one in C and another in Python. Teams can choose the language set they are most comfortable with at the start.

Setup:
Each team will be allowed to work with one laptop throughout the competition. The event is divided into three rounds and a timer is displayed.
Round Links will be hosted on website for the teams to access the questions.
VSCode is mandatory in every teamâ€™s system. 

Evaluation Criteria:
Teams will be judged on two primary factors: the number of questions they solve correctly and the time taken to complete each round.

Round Details: 
Round 1: Easy debugging round
Features 10 easy questions to test fundamental programming knowledge.
Each question carries 2 points.
Bonus carries 2 points.

Round 2: Moderate debugging round
Features 5 moderate questions to test problem-solving and coding efficiency.
Each question carries 3 points.
Bonus carries 3 points.

Round 3: Hard debugging round
Features 2 difficult questions that require advanced programming skills.
Each question carries 5 points.
Bonus carries 5 points.

Note: Bonus points are awarded only to those teams who debug all questions of the respective round. 

Team Qualification:
A leaderboard is updated after every round with the current scores.
Results from the 3 rounds is evaluated and the top-performing teams are selected.
The number of teams advancing to subsequent rounds is based on the total registrations: 40-50% of the total registered teams will advance to the next round.
